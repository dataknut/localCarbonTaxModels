# local Emissions Levy Models

Automatically generated reports that model a residential emissions levy for local areas and compare the Â£ levy generated with the estimated cost of retrofitting 'to an acceptable standard'.

The model runs at the Census [Lower Layer Super Output Area](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography#super-output-area-soa) level (LSOA: ~1,500 households) for **England only** and the results can be aggregated up to most geographical boundaries.

Examples:

 * [East Suffolk](simulating_local_emissions_levy_East Suffolk.html) - **health warning: partial results due to incomplete LSOA/LA level data linkage**
 * [Portsmouth](simulating_local_emissions_levy_Portsmouth.html)
 * Southampton:
